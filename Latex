## Introduction

This analysis presents an in-depth time series examination of dispensing data. Utilizing robust statistical packages in R such as `astsa`, `forecast`, `dplyr`, and `zoo`, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and predict future dispensing activities.

## Methodology

The process involves loading the dataset, converting it into a time series object, visualizing the trend, and employing forecasting techniques to predict future values. Our approach leverages Auto ARIMA modeling to accurately forecast dispensing data.

## Data Preparation and Visualization

The data, sourced from a `quiet.csv` file, was converted into a time series object with a monthly frequency starting from January 2011. Initial data visualization was performed to understand the basic trends and seasonality present in the data.

### Visualization

Below is a snippet of the code used for data visualization:

```r
plot(quet.ts, ylim=c(0,40000), type='l', col="blue", xlab="Month", ylab="Dispensings")
abline(v=2014, col="gray", lty="dashed", lwd=2)
