SAMPLE CONTENT
Background: The paper emphasizes the growing use of interrupted time series analysis for evaluating large-scale health interventions. Segmented regression is noted as common but sometimes insufficient due to seasonality and autocorrelation. An ARIMA model is presented as a more adaptable alternative.

Methods: The paper elaborates on ARIMA model theory and its application in assessing population-level health policy implementations. It outlines steps like selecting the model’s impact shape, the model selection process, transfer functions, checking model fit, and interpretation of findings. The paper provides R and SAS code examples for replication.

Results: The study showcases ARIMA modeling through a case study on policy intervention aimed at reducing inappropriate prescribing. Specifically, it examines the effects of the Australian government’s January 2014 policy that removed prescription refills for 25 mg quetiapine tablets to prevent off-label use, using prescription claims data.

Conclusions: ARIMA modeling is highlighted as a valuable method for assessing the impact of substantial interventions, especially when other methods are less appropriate. It effectively handles trends, autocorrelation, and seasonality, and it is versatile in modeling different impact types .

\title{Empirical Study Example}

\maketitle

This document outlines an example for conducting an empirical study, particularly focusing on a transfer function model, as per the requirements of an economic finance course. The transfer function model is a valuable tool in econometrics for analyzing the dynamic relationship between a set of variables.

\section*{Empirical Study Approach}

The empirical study involves specifying a model that captures the essential dynamics of the economic phenomena under investigation. For this purpose, a transfer function model is utilized to examine the relationship between an independent variable (or set of variables) and a dependent variable, considering the lag effects and potential autoregressive properties of the dependent variable.

\section*{Transfer Function Model Equation}

The general form of the transfer function model can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{t-1} + \dots + \beta_p X_{t-p} + \varepsilon_t
\end{equation}

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Y_t$ represents the dependent variable at time $t$.
    \item $X_{t-1}, \dots, X_{t-p}$ are the lagged values of the independent variable(s) affecting $Y_t$.
    \item $\beta_0, \beta_1, \dots, \beta_p$ are the coefficients to be estimated, indicating the impact of the lagged independent variables on $Y_t$.
    \item $\varepsilon_t$ is the error term, representing the part of $Y_t$ not explained by the lagged values of $X$.
\end{itemize}

This model allows for the examination of how previous values of the independent variable(s) influence the current value of the dependent variable, capturing the dynamic adjustments and time-dependent effects within the economic system.

\section*{Model Estimation and Interpretation}

Model estimation is performed using statistical software, which involves fitting the specified transfer function model to the observed data. The estimated coefficients ($\beta$s) reveal the nature and magnitude of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables across different lags. Interpretation of these coefficients provides insights into the temporal dynamics of the economic phenomena under study.

with my code being r studio the data is included in the r package
To provide a comprehensive guide for researchers and policymakers on using interrupted time series (ITS) analysis with autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to evaluate the impact of large-scale health interventions. ITS analysis is a powerful statistical technique for assessing the effect of interventions over time, especially when randomized controlled trials are not feasible. ARIMA models, which account for underlying trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation in time series data, enhance the robustness of ITS analyses. The objective is to improve the understanding and application of ITS-ARIMA in evaluating health policy and program interventions, ensuring accurate, credible results that can inform policy decisions and public health practice.
\item Methodology:
The guide will outline the step-by-step methodology for conducting ITS analysis using ARIMA models, including:
Data Requirements: Specification of the types of data needed, such as continuous and evenly spaced time series data on health outcomes before and after the intervention.
Model Specification: Guidance on selecting appropriate ARIMA models based on the data's characteristics, including the process of identifying the order of autoregression, degree of differencing, and moving average components.
Intervention Analysis: Techniques for estimating the intervention's impact, including changes in level and trend of the health outcome after the intervention, while controlling for pre-intervention trends.
Model Validation: Methods for validating the fit of the ARIMA model, including diagnostics checks for autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, and residuals analysis.
\item Expected Outcomes:
The guide is expected to:
Enhance researchers' capacity to rigorously evaluate health interventions using time series analysis.
Provide a standardized approach to ITS-ARIMA analysis, facilitating comparability across studies.
Offer insights into the interpretation of ITS-ARIMA results, including understanding the magnitude and significance of the intervention's impact.
\item Policy Implications:
By improving the quality of evaluation research, the guide aims to support evidence-based policymaking in health. It will help policymakers and public health officials make informed decisions about the continuation, modification, or termination of health interventions based on their demonstrated effectiveness.
\item Target Audience:
The guide is intended for epidemiologists, health economists, public health researchers, and policymakers involved in the design, implementation, and evaluation of health interventions.
\item Dissemination:
Plans for disseminating the guide include publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at public health and epidemiology conferences, and workshops for health policymakers and researchers. An online version of the guide will also be made available to ensure broad access.
\item Collaboration and Support:
The development of the guide will involve collaboration with experts in epidemiology, biostatistics, and health policy. Support from public health organizations and research institutions will be sought to ensure the guide's relevance and applicability across various health interventions and contexts.
