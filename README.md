\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Objective:} To provide a comprehensive guide on employing ARIMA models in ITS analysis for assessing the impact of health interventions.
    \item \textbf{Methodology \& Instrument:} Detailed explanation on integrating ARIMA models within ITS analysis to handle autocorrelation, seasonality, and non-stationarity in health-related time series data.
    \item \textbf{Reason:} ARIMA models offer advanced capabilities for more accurately estimating intervention effects over time, addressing issues traditional ITS analysis may overlook.
    \item \textbf{Data:} Utilization of health intervention data, illustrating the application of ARIMA models in real-world scenarios.
    \item \textbf{Results:} Enhanced precision in determining the effectiveness of health interventions, contributing to more informed policy-making and program development.

# Interrupted Time Series Analysis Using ARIMA Models

## Objective
This guide provides a comprehensive overview of employing ARIMA models in Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis to assess the impact of large-scale health interventions.

## Methodology & Instrument
The guide details integrating ARIMA models within ITS analysis to handle autocorrelation, seasonality, and non-stationarity in health-related time series data.

## Data
Utilization of health intervention data illustrates the application of ARIMA models in real-world scenarios.

## Results
Enhanced precision in determining the effectiveness of health interventions, contributing to informed policy-making and program development.

## How to Use This Repository
- Clone the repository and navigate to the code directory.
- Data is included in the R package, and the analysis can be replicated using RStudio.
- Follow the step-by-step methodology outlined for conducting ITS analysis using ARIMA models.

## Target Audience
Epidemiologists, health economists, public health researchers, and policymakers involved in the design, implementation, and evaluation of health interventions.

## Dissemination
The guide will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and workshops, with an online version available for broader access.

## Collaboration and Support
Development involved collaboration with experts and sought support from health organizations to ensure applicability across various interventions.

## Contact
For any queries or collaboration, please reach out through [GitHub issues](link-to-your-github-issues) or directly via email (your-email@domain.com).
